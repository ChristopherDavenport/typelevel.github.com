Hello Community!

Gitter has struggled as a platform for Typelevel for many reasons. We have received feedback that the platform is hard to approach,
and that the sense of community is fractured by being in seperate rooms, and difficult for beginners since you have to know where to get started.
Additionally mobile support has completely deteriorated throughout the years,
and the only users who remain satisfied unconditionally are perhaps those who are using bridges.

Typelevel is a safe and inclusive community and leveraging tools that align with our community driven goals, will help allow us to build even better spaces.

In that light we have decided to switch platforms from Gitter to Discord. 

Discord is a modern platform with solid support across all devices, 
best-in-class moderation tools both personally and administratively, and builds from the baseline of the typelevel community rather than individual tech silos.

There are some shortcoming in that links in discord require being a member in the community, and we hope to better document tech support thats presently managed
in chat to be handled via github discussions and/or issues to give more clear documentation than living in these chat locations.
We will work together to find the approaches make resources available, and rely less on having the right link saved somewhere. 
This will, if managed correctly, leave us in a better place than we are today.
