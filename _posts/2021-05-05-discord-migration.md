Hello Community!

Gitter has struggled as a platform for Typelevel for many reasons. We have received feedback that the platform is hard to approach,
and that the sense of community is fractured by being in seperate rooms, and difficult for beginners since you have to know where to get started.
Additionally, mobile support has completely deteriorated throughout the years.
The only users who remain satisfied unconditionally are perhaps those who are using bridges.

In that light we have decided to switch platforms on a trial basis from Gitter to Discord. After 3 months we will re-evaluate whether this new platform is meeting the communities needs effectively.

Typelevel is a safe and inclusive community and we wish to leverage tools that align with our community driven goals. Discord will help allow us to build even better spaces. Discord is a modern platform with solid support across all devices, 
best-in-class moderation tools both personally and administratively, and builds the Typelevel community as a whole rather than per repo silos.

There are some shortcomings, in discord, links require logging in and being a member of the community to view. We hope to better document tech support that's presently managed
in chat to be handled via github discussions and/or issues to give more clear documentation than living in these chat locations.
We will work together to find approaches to make resources more readily available, and rely less on having the right link saved somewhere. 
This will, if managed correctly, leave us in a better place than we are today.
